=============

Web interface to test your regexes. Add as many text snippets you want the regex to match or not match and hit submit. Can export and import current test from json format. Done in pure javascript and minimal Flask for the backend.

*Install flask with pip install flask
*Run python webs.py [-d for debug mode] to start the webserver
